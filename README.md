# Project Layout

- FinalReport.pdf is a written report for this project detailing my experiments, results, and research
- Inception.ipynb is a notebook containing thorough code for reproducing my results. It contains the model definition and results (in cell outputs) for the CNN based - InceptionResNet based model in this competition.
- ViT.ipynb is a similar notebook for reproducing my transformer based results and contains the outputs from previous runs.
- ViT_Simple.ipynb is the same as ViT.ipynb but contains a slightly different model definition (with reduced complexity) and also adds image augmentation to the preprocessing.
- plots.ipynb contains the code used to generate the figures in my final report.
